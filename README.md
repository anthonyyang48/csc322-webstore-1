# A&K Custom PC

The software product, A&K Custom PC, is an online computer store that can be accessed by guests, ordinary users and privileged users

## Scope

The goal of the store is to allow ordinary users to build and purchase computers and computer parts. For computers, ordinary users can either customize compatible components or purchase suggested computer builds set up by privileged users on the home page. Guests can browse all available items, but can’t make purchases unless they convert to ordinary users. To collect user feedback on items, guests and ordinary users can provide comments. To ensure ordinary users’ satisfaction over their purchase, they can rate their purchases on a scale from 1 to 5. They can also communicate with privileged users which both parties can either compliment or complain about each other with justifications. When commenting or communicating, the system will penalize any user for inappropriate language. Since different users have different features, their user experience will be personalized.
